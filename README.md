# DiabetesAI - Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts diabetes risk using clinical features. The application uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## Model Overview

The diabetes prediction model is built using a Random Forest Classifier, which:
- Uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions
- Analyzes 8 clinical features to assess diabetes risk
- Provides feature importance analysis for transparency
- Trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset

### Key Features Used
1. **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
2. **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration (2 hours after glucose tolerance test)
3. **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (Î¼U/ml)
6. **BMI**: Body mass index
7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function scoring likelihood of diabetes based on family history
8. **Age**: Age in years

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Users input their health metrics through a user-friendly interface
2. **Preprocessing**: The application processes and validates the input data
3. **Prediction**: The Random Forest model analyzes the features and provides a risk assessment
4. **Explanation**: Results are displayed with:
   - Clear risk indication (High Risk/Low Risk)
   - Feature importance visualization
   - Key metrics analysis

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy

## Model Performance
The Random Forest model was trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and achieves:
- Accuracy: 77.3%
- Precision: 79% (weighted average)
- Recall: 77% (weighted average)
- F1-Score: 78% (weighted average)

Class-wise Performance:
- Non-diabetic (Class 0):
